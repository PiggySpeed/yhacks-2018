Upper gastrointestinal ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months and in ~2–4% of patients treated for 1 year; these trends continue with longer duration of use",

      "short_description": "Skeletal Muscle Relaxants",
      "long_description": "Most muscle relaxants poorly tolerated by older adults because some have anticholinergic adverse effects, sedation, increased risk of fractures; effectiveness at dosages tolerated by older adults questionable",
